            </div>

            <p align="justify">Over the past few days I noticed that something unusual was trending in the news.  The headlines kept reading, “<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/07/473438101/call-a-random-swede-we-tried-it-out">Call a random Swede</a>” – apparently the country of Sweden issued its own phone number last week where anyone could call and speak with an actual Swedish local on the other end.  Of course I was intrigued by the concept and as the co-founder of a travel startup I love the idea of connecting with locals.<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/07/call-a-random-swede---we-tested-the-swedish-tourist-boards-quirk/">The Telegraph</a>, The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/europe/sweden-call-random-swede-number.html">New York Times</a> and even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/08/travel/sweden-phone-number-launch/">CNN</a> picked up the story so I just had to try out the service and see for myself.  One important note is that even though you are calling a Swedish number you can place the call as if it were a local number if you call from a few select countries including the US, UK, Denmark, Brazil and France (they have separate numbers you can call from those countries and a few others).</p>
                <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">I called <a href="https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/">Sweden</a> a total of five times and was connected with a random Swede on four out of five calls.  I made the calls between 2 pm and 4 pm EST so between 8 pm and 10 pm Swedish time.</p>
                <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">I didn’t follow a script and decided to just wing it! I tried my best not to mention Ikea, Swedish meatballs or Donald Trump and managed to only mention two out of three of those things! Everyone I spoke with was so extremely friendly and gave me detailed answers to all my annoying questions.  One thing I didn’t consider was how long and complicated Swedish names and places are so I ended up having to spell out things multiple times and very, very slowly – but it was fun and I always appreciate the uniqueness of languages!</p>
                <div class="space30"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Call #1:</strong> No answer! The country must have been super busy and everyone was having dinner – but I didn’t give up. Hey – Swedes got to eat!</p>
                <div class="space30"></div>

            <p><strong>Call #2:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jonas</p>
            <p><strong>Town in Sweden:</strong> Vasteras</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Reason for becoming a “random Swede”:</strong> His wife found an ad in the newspaper and thought it would be a great way to help market Sweden- and to keep him busy!</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>What we talked about:</strong> Jonas was extremely polite and I was trying my best not to bring up Swedish meatballs (on my first call) so I started asking him about food in general and what he loves to eat.  In the spring and summertime Jonas loves salmon (lox) and has a great recipe for grilling it along with his fabulous potato salad.  Of course Swedish meatballs are very popular (he brought this up – I didn’t!), and apparently pizza and kebabs are becoming popular.  It also turns out that Tex-Mex is popular especially on Friday’s – but they eat their Mexican food with a lot less seasoning (hold the cumin!).  The town of Vasteras is known for the <a href="http://bigmeet.com/eng/">Power Big Meet</a> from July 2nd – 4th – the largest American car show in the world! Even <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-c1-jay-lenos-garage-20140714-story.html">Jay Leno</a> brings his cars here! This conversation was very entertaining and at the end of the call he thanked me for calling the country of Sweden.</p>
                <div class="space30"></div>


            <p><strong>Call #3:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Matias</p>
            <p><strong>City in Sweden:</strong> Stockholm; Kungsholmen Island</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Reason for becoming a “random Swede”:</strong> He thought it would be interesting and wanted to connect with people about Sweden</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>What we talked about:</strong> During this call I wanted to express my interest in visiting Sweden, traveling to Stockholm and living like a local.  Matias gave me an excellent geography lesson – apparently Sweden is made up of 14 islands and he stays on the island of <a href="http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/See--do/Guides/District-guide-Kungsholmen/">Kungsholmen</a> (I had to ask how to spell it – twice – and finally gave up and Googled it), which is famous for their City Hall.  He told me to find a hotel or hostel (not an Airbnb) on the “young hip” island of <a href="http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/regions--cities/stockholm/culture-in-stockholm/the-millennium-tour/">Sodermalm</a> which has a lot of fun cafes and restaurants.  He even recommended that for a local experience visit the <a href="http://www.pelikan.se/en/">Pelikan</a> known for its traditional Swedish dishes (including meatballs, reindeer stew and elk patties).  Matias also recommended <a href="http://www.kvarnen.com/index.php/se/">Restaurant Kvarnen</a>, an old-world beer hall made famous by crime novelist <a href="http://www.stieglarsson.com/">Stieg Larsson</a>, author of <a href="http://www.dragontattoo.com/site/">Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> – another must visit location!  In Sweden breakfast is mostly a “cold” one consisting of dairy, yogurt, granola, bread and coffee.  They are also famous for their breakfast sandwiches.  Matias said that the best month to vacation is Sweden is August since many Swedes vacation in July and the weather is also particularly good.  We had an excellent conversation and it ended very politely with Matias saying “thank you for calling Sweden!”  The more locals I spoke with the more I wanted to visit Sweden!</p>

            <p><strong>Call #4:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong>Maria</p>
            <p><strong>Town in Sweden:</strong> Pitea</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Reason for becoming a ‘random Swede’:</strong> Saw a Facebook post and thought it was a joke and decided to sign up to practice her English.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>What we spoke about:</strong> I started out by asking Maria why she decided to become a ‘random Swede’ and in addition to the answer above she said she registered on Saturday (April 9th) and received her first call within 10 minutes.  She has received calls from all over the world – mostly from the US but also from as far away as Kazakhstan, Australia and Canada. Maria said most people she has spoken with ask about such varied topics as how do Swedes plan their five-week paid-vacation time and the Swedish health-care system.  I asked Maria if she had ever been to New York and she said she visited Buffalo for a <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/">Bruce Springsteen</a> concert years ago – and loved it – despite it being February!  I asked Maria about what was popular in her city and it turns out she is very close to the <a href="http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html">Northern Lights</a>.  Every winter for anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours each day the purple, green and yellow aurora lights put on a show! In the northern town of <a href="http://www.kirunalapland.se/en/">Kiruna</a> visitors can stay in the famous <a href="http://www.icehotel.com/">ice hotel</a> – which is spectacular! After speaking with Maria I was convinced that my next vacation was definitely to Sweden – and maybe even during winter!</p>

            <p><strong>Call #5:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Anna-Karin</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Town in Sweden:</strong> I tried spelling the name several times and not even Google could figure out what I wrote</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Reason for wanting to be a ‘random Swede’:</strong> Anna-Karin wanted to practice her English and is excited to help others learn about Sweden</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>What we talked about:</strong> I steered the conversation towards food (because it’s my snack time in the US and I was hungry) so Anna-Karin told me that her favorite things to cook are potatoes and moose steaks with cream sauce – at that point I was so hungry I would have eaten it! Anna-Karin is a social worker who loves helping people so it was only natural that she signed up to be a ‘random Swede’ and she had already spoken with people from Italy, Germany and even Pakistan in the few short days since she had signed up.  At that point I had to run but it was a pleasure speaking with Anna-Karin and I had a fun helping her with her English!</p>

            <h5><u><strong>How would I rate The Swedish Number?</strong></u></h5>
                <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">I had the best time speaking to random Swedish people and I hate calling them “random” since I now feel like Jonas, Matias, Maria and Anna-Karin are now friends! The service was a lot of fun and I can see why it’s drawing a lot of attention in the press.  The four people I spoke with were so polite, interesting and inquisitive – and Sweden is next on my vacation list!  I would say however that if you are actually planning a trip to Sweden be prepared for a list of very long, complicated names and ask if a local can write it down and e-mail their recommendations – or you can use <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/#/">Your Local Cousin</a> for that!</p>
