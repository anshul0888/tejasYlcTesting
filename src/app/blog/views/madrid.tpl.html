            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><a href="http://unbuendiaenmadrid.com/areia-bar-chillout-en-madrid-zona-chueca-alonso-martinez/">Areia</a> is Spanish for sand and this bar is known for its extensive choice of cocktails ranging from Cosmopolitan, Dry Martini, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3683/negroni-drink-recipe/">Negroni</a>, Daiquiris, <a href="http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink1385.html">Blue Hawaian</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/patrick-and-gina-neely/ginas-brown-sugar-mojito-recipe.html">Brown Mojito</a>, Margarita and many more. The atmosphere of this bar is very relaxing. The name of this bar gives everything away, once you step into the bar, you feel like you are on holidays. The interior is designed with oriental decoration and dim lighting and the prices of the cocktails are fairly reasonable. I recommend this bar because it is very enjoyable and it was one of the first bars I have visited in Spain. During the day, they serve food too, such as <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/tapas">Spanish tapas</a> and of course it looks a lot different at day time. Another plus point it that the music is not too loud, which makes it easy to have a conversation with your friends. Almost all my friends from home, who came to visit me enjoyed this bar.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.madlifemadrid.com/the-best-blues-bars-of-madrid-with-live-music/">El Junco</a> stands for rush in Spanish. El Junco is most probably the most lively and vibrant jazz bars in Madrid. The bar has live jazz and funk music and allows talented musicians to take part in a live jam session. This is the place to be if you like good music. You can try out Spanish beers, Spanish rum, <a href="http://www.wineintro.com/sangria/history.html">Sangria</a>, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3769/cuba-libre-drink-recipe/">cuba libre</a> and many more. This bar is quite unique because it offers a completely different ambience. I got introduced to this bar by some friends who were involved in the music industry, therefore I could watch them play and enjoy concerts to escape the reality for a while. Each week there is a different performer and that’s where I started to discover jazz music. The singer pictured below had a very graceful voice and absorbed the audience. </p>

            <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/madrid/tarde-y-noche/madrid/terraza-le-cabrera-casa-de-america">Terraza  Le Cabrera</a> is a great spot for hot summer days. Many people rave about this terrace bar because it is hidden, chic and modern. However, keep in mind that it this is an upscale bar. Many “after work” parties are organized at this bar. It is definitely worth a visit, but it’s not open throughout the whole year. This bar is surely a treat, if you want to reward yourself after a hard day at work or uni. They serve mojitos, caipirinhas, bloody marry, cosmopolitan, heineken and <a href="http://www.beersofeurope.co.uk/spanish-beer">Spanish beers</a> and many more. I like this bar because it is very different to other places and the target group is a lot older. I would recommend this place if you are into networking as it is slightly upscale. I liked this bar a lot because I remember having really good hotdogs, which is unusual for Spain. </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">This is one of the uber-upscale terrace bars in Madrid because of its view overlooking the football stadium <a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/en/santiago-bernabeu-stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a>. The bar is next to a restaurant for which you need to make reservations. I came to this bar for a special occasion and it was very chic and calm, because the stadium was completely empty in the afternoon. Your money’s worth it because you get to enjoy a memorable view in one of the world’s classified elite stadiums. As you can see on the photo below, they serve different kinds of gin & tonic, beers, mojitos, <a href="http://stevethebartender.com.au/caipiroska/">caipiroska</a>, caipirinha, cuba libre, bloody marry etc. I remember this venue, because a friend of mine had organized her farewell party there, which brings back good old memories looking back at the photos. I liked this bar because it is one of the exclusive bars, you would come here to celebrate something. </p>

            <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.guiadelocio.com/madrid/tarde-y-noche/madrid/el-imperfecto">El Imperfecto</a> packs a lot of character. The cute little bar is located in the heart of Madrid, in <a href="http://mividaen.sampere.com/neighborhoods-in-madrid-huertas">Huertas</a>. The bar attracts many local residents of Madrid as well as an international crowd. You can enjoy refreshing cocktails, sangria and fresh juices. Sometimes they have live music too. This bar made me feel like it was decorated for a music video or an old movie scene. I enjoyed this bar especially because I felt like I was stuck in time or I was in an artist’s living room. It gives you comforting vibes and is very vintage in my opinion. I would also call this place one of the most hipster bars in town. </p>

            <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.grupoadolfo.com/terraza-cibeles.html">Terraza de Palacio de Cibeles</a> is considered one of the most popular gems in Madrid, because of its impressive architecture and it’s spectacular skyline view over Madrid. The building <a href="http://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/palacio-de-cibeles">Palacio Cibeles</a> was previously known as the Palace of Communication and has become Madrid’s iconic monuments. You won’t regret popping up to the roof to enjoy the breathtaking view. Here you get to drink different kinds of gin & tonic, mojitos, bloody marry, <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Tinto-de-Verano">tinto de verano</a>, cosmopolitan, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/08/make-your-own-aperol-spritz">aperol spritz</a>, wine, etc. I hold this bar dearly to my heart because I got to spend my 22nd Birthday there and I remember when Spain won the Worldcup in 2010, there was a champions parade at this venue and around it. It was a great day for Spain, despite the fact that they were struggling economically. It was an unforgettable day because you could feel the excitement in the air, as everyone cheered for the country. </p>

            <p align="justify">This is the bar is on top of the <a href="http://oscar.room-matehotels.com/en">hotel</a> and you can relax and soak in some sun in the summer because it has a swimming pool too. The terrace bar has a very enjoyable atmosphere with electronic, deep house and lounge music and mainly attracts young crowds. It is very inviting and has a special place in my heart. A must-go for sure! I like this bar because it’s very cosy. This is one of the last bars I went to before I closed my chapter in Madrid. Here you can drink mojitos as pictured below, dirty martini, caipirinha, caipiroska, cuba libre, <a href="http://www.liicetea.com/">long island ice tea</a>, etc.  The building is beautifully designed and very urban and white. I had lots of fun here especially on my friend’s Birthday party, and it happened to be raining heavily that day, so we had the venue to ourselves, which made us feel like VIPs :D This bar is also located nearby my old flat, and the neighbourhood is full of life and energy.

            <p align="justify">The <a href="http://www.nakedmadrid.com/2014/04/14/madrids-best-rooftop-bars-round-1/">Tartán Roof</a> is situated on top of <a href="http://www.circulobellasartes.com/">Círculo de Bellas Artes</a> (the fine arts building) and overlooks the Plaza de Cibeles. However, you need to pay an entrance ticket of 3€ to go upstairs. Pictures won’t do justice of the most incredible panoramic view of the city and you can watch the sunset in this cool rooftop bar. Here they serve wine, aperol, mojito, cosmopolitan, spritzer, margarita, <a href="http://www.drinkswap.com/red-russian.htm">red russian</a>, etc. I like this rooftop bar because it is very international. I highly recommend this exquisite rooftop bar because it was one of the last ones I discovered and would have regretted if I missed the opportunity to capture Madrid from above, given that I am a rooftop fan. I also treasure this place because I got to show my parents how magical Madrid is. </p>
