            <p align="justify"><a href="http://rachelgrant.com/">Rachel Grant</a> is a Bond Girl (Die Another Day), former Miss Hawaiian Tropic and was Angelina Jolie’s stunt double in Tomb Raider.  This bombshell is also an author, humanitarian and adventure traveler, having visited over 70 countries! Rachel is one of the tour guides in the new Bravo reality TV show, <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/tour-group">Tour Group</a>, with new episodes airing this May. We were lucky to chat with her about travel, her sense for adventure and what inspires her journey. This is a two-part interview so look for Part 2 coming in May!</p>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" alt="" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/rssiaIcUQGacFJRmQ5Z1" alt="Adventure travel mixed with travel philanthropy">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Aarti:</strong> Your travel style is very unique and combines high-end, luxury experiences with adventure travel and often times has a focus on philanthropy.   Can you tell us about how this style evolved?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Rachel:</strong> I really enjoy travel philanthropy, my work with children and coming across humble communities.  A while back I was traveling around Kenya for several months working on a movie and I was staying in such luxurious places.   But I just had this desire to get away and see what the country is really like so on that trip I would walk off on my own to explore.  I found a local school and had the chance to get involved in community outreach and I was continually finding that interacting and giving back to local communities was a lot more fulfilling than staying at luxury hotels.  Now I usually incorporate philanthropy as part of my travels.
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Several years back while in the <a href="http://rachelgrant.com/collections/travel-snaps/products/philippines">Philippines</a> I came across an indigenous community in Pangasinan, a part of Western Lusson, and the children didn’t have a school there and had just survived a typhoon so they literally lost everything.  Despite having few resources they were rebuilding their community as best they could and I was very inspired by them. They had just lost everything but yet they were still happy and making the most of their life! We complain about so many things and we take a lot for granted.  At a community event during that trip I said, “I’m going to build you a typhoon shelter and this is going to double up as a school during the day” – this literally came out of my mouth while I was on a podium because I knew I had to do something.  However, back in New York I thought to myself “how am I going to raise these funds?”  That was three years ago – and a year ago I raised the money! It was a real accomplishment and it’s these experiences I remember most.

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <strong>Aarti:</strong> What is the one place you have visited that has completely changed your views on life and how you view the world?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> When I went to Ecuador I visited the <a href="http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/oceans-narrated-by-sylvia-earle/oceans-galapagos">Galapagos Islands</a> and it’s the last place on earth where giant tortoises live and the reptiles and the birds they have there are truly amazing.  Giant tortoises used to roam every continent except for Antarctica and everything was much bigger before so it really puts the world in perspective.  The Galapagos changed how Darwin thought and it was a real eye opener for me as well. I also went on a dive where I was completely surrounded by sharks and fish and found myself in a school of hammerheads! So many of these animals in the Galapagos are extinct in the rest of the world and I was just gobsmacked by my experiences!

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> For a traveller looking to take a more “adventurous” trip for the first time, how can they best plan their experience? How do you plan your trips?
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I don’t purchase guidebooks and honestly many of the places I go to are not listed on TripAdvisor.   Sometimes I post on TripAdvisor but sometimes I don’t want people to know about places - so I don’t add them!   My best source for planning a trip like this is to ask locals.   I usually do some planning beforehand and if you have friends in a country or you have a connection to the country you can ask them. Facebook is another great resource.  For example there was a turtle sanctuary in Southern Luzon in the Philippines that I had never been to, I didn’t know the people and connected with them on Facebook and asked them if I could volunteer with them.  I wanted to work with a turtle sanctuary and collect eggs while learning about turtles.  They were very open to it and responded right away.
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Sometimes asking the locals while in-destination works really well like on my trip to <a href="http://visitnicaragua.us/">Nicaragua</a>.  I wanted to visit local schools so I asked waiters about where I could go.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">In this case I wanted an experience I couldn’t find in a guidebooks - this was not a tourist experience and the locals helped.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" alt="" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PiEIhDG5Q66d6Kx45rRh" alt="Philippines travel experience, volunteering during travel">

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> How can someone best plan a trip that involves volunteering?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> There are many websites that help plan volunteering abroad but many of them make a lot of money off of volunteering and I just don’t agree with that. Sucheta Rawal has a fabulous website, <a href="http://www.goeatgive.com/">http://www.goeatgive.com</a>, and I recommend her website. I’ve seen some websites where they charge a lot of money and once you reach your destination you don’t really get a chance to connect with the local people.  Instead you are on a schedule building something or planting something but it isn’t a real cultural experience.  Companies based in the US that charge high prices – I wouldn’t recommend using them.  What I do is contact a charity directly. If you contact the organization directly a) it isn’t going to cost you anything extra and b) you are really dealing with the local people out there.   You can also be really specific with what you want and deal with the locals vs. a more structured approach that is completely outlined for you and that is really a “voluntour” and you have to ask yourself “is this just making you feel good or are you really doing good things?”  In terms of safety, look for only those charities that are registered and have been established for years.  You will end up with lifelong friends – these are people who will want you back again and again and again.

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" alt="" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/AKlHb7uCTveWMVnYBVjR" alt="Managing business and fitness routine while traveling">

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> What is your beauty and fitness routine while traveling?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I won’t go to the gym even at the most luxurious hotels because I would rather go hiking up a mountain or exercise outdoors.  On a recent Facebook post I was mentioning the Sahara Hotel in Morocco and how it has this amazing spa and fitness center and it overlooks the <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/365-photos/middle-atlas-morocco/">Atlas Mountains</a>.  Someone commented “that looks so cool, are you are hitting the gym?” and I said “no! Why would I go to the gym when I can hit the mountain!”  It’s such a waste of time being at a gym – you can walk instead.  I love to eat everything and anything so I love walking, hiking, and even cycling.
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">In terms of beauty I like to try native beauty treatments like mud masks or sitting in volcanic ash.  In Morocco they have this rejuvenation treatment where you sit in really hot sand.  I like trying the natural products that are from the region including <a href="http://www.instyle.com/fashion/our-10-favorite-argan-oil-infused-products">argan oil</a> and coconut oil and I also like to bring back small samples back home.  In Ecuador I brought back a bottle of prickly pear that the locals consume to help prevent cancer.  In Thailand they put snails all over your face because the snail slime is suppose to be good for you.  I’ve also put my feet into tubs filled with little fish where they eat the dead skin in Thailand.  In Japan the <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/beauty/skin-treatments/geisha-facial3.htm">geishas would apply bird poop on their skin</a>, which is suppose to be great – I’ve never done that but I want to!  You can also get a snake massage in certain parts of the world! Buying the natural resources of the country supports the local communities.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">In the Amazon, the tribe I met uses a “hair brush” – it hangs on a tree and is essentially a black shell with spikes coming out of it.  I remember brushing my hair with that and thinking “this actually works!”</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" alt="" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/UsbmzQEcQDyyXbiWZ9wi" alt='"Hair brush" in the form of black shell used by tribes in Amazon'>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> Can you tell us about the items you absolutely most pack in your suitcase?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I always pack chocolates and sweets from the UK or the US because when I take the time to visit a school or go meet locals this is my gift to them.  I always have a selection of Cadbury chocolates and Hershey’s Kisses – and it’s heavy – but I give up a little bit of my space and that becomes my souvenir space when returning! In many countries tipping isn’t customary and this one time I had the nicest taxi driver so I gave him a box of chocolates and he was so appreciative.
            <div class="space20"></div>


            <strong>Aarti:</strong> You travel extensively and have visited close to 70 countries.  What places are you most excited about visiting in the year ahead?

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I’ve been looking at a destination recently and people think I’m a little crazy to want to visit El Salvador, the “murder capital of the world”.  I’m looking to visit <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/675">Joya de Ceren</a>, the “Pompeii of the Americas”.  It’s a Mayan village that was covered in volcanic ash – just like Pompeii – and its been excavated in the last couple of years and is open to the public. Their pots and pans were so perfectly preserved and I believe It is the most perfectly preserved Mayan village in the Americas.  I’ve been seeing images of Joya de Ceren and I’m excited to visit! I’m really fascinated with excavation and the area around it is supposed to be breathtaking.  There are seven volcanoes, stunning hikes, and great beaches. I’m always looking to go somewhere where people don’t want to visit as much, either because it’s dangerous or unexplored.
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">In the Eastern Hemisphere I want to travel to Bhutan and Myanmar.  I’m actually taking a tour to the Philippines in a month called the NOW Philippines Tour 2016.   Several celebrities are helping to promote the tour including Apple from the <a href="http://www.blackeyedpeas.com/">Black Eyed Peas</a>, Jessica Sanchez from American Idol and even <a href="http://www.missuniverse.com/members/profile/662855">Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach</a>, Miss Universe 2016 from the Philippines.  I’m the face of the tour and I’m also the tour guide.  The tour lasts one week this coming April.  There are still spots left!</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> You were just in Vegas and attended the <a href="http://travel-goods.org/">Travel Goods Show</a>.  Can you tell us about some of the cool new items and accessories that you discovered while there?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I design luggage for <a href="http://www.biaggi.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwwpm3BRDuh5awn4qJpLwBEiQAATTAQZCBFqLmEKeofXxM1nk7GVuvzN1uUmHebp9Ix_HUKx0aAsaD8P8HAQ">Biaggi</a>, a company that was featured on <a href="http://sharktanksuccess.blogspot.com/2014/11/biaggi-folding-luggage.html">Shark Tank</a>.  They make luggage that folds and they needed accessories that compliment their luggage line.  They have a new little pouch that you stick in your suitcase and when you run out of bags it opens up and becomes a tote bag.  It’s very handy!  There is also a cosmetics bag that opens up.
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">A company called <a href="http://www.cocoon.at/eng/show.php?doc=frameset&page=home">Cocoon</a> based in the USA makes great silk dresses, sleepwear and even blankets that shrink down.  Silk is very light, easy to pack and very easy to clean.  You can just dip silk in soap and water and it dries in a few hours so I like the products from Cocoon.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Aarti:</strong> If you had to choose between visiting the fictional world of Oz (<a href="http://thewizardofoz.warnerbros.com/">Wizard of Oz</a>) or the fictional world of <a href="http://www.harrypotterwizardscollection.com/">Harry Potter</a> (Hogwarts), which would you choose and why?
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <strong>Rachel:</strong> I would want to visit the fictional world of Oz from the Wizard of Oz because I grew up loving it.  It is one of the first movies that I watched as a child and it inspired me to become an actress.  I use to tell myself, “I’m going to move to Hollywood – and move to the states” and it actually happened! I moved to the US nine years ago and really pursued my dream.  As a child I looked at Dorothy and thought she was so determined to reach her destination and the movie taught me that you can really go anywhere if you really believe you can.  Dorothy also returns back to her roots and she is home again.  In the same way I return back to the Philippines and my roots and I’ve never taken my roots for granted!  The more I go back the more I realize it’s really beautiful to have another culture as part of your upbringing.
