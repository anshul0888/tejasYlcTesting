<p>Three cousins founded Your Local Cousin (<a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com">https://www.yourlocalcousin.com</a>) the Airbnb for travel advice, which is part of the peer-to-peer on-demand sharing economy. We connect travelers who are looking for customized travel advice with vetted locals for conversations over text messaging and Skype / Facetime and customized itineraries and maps. We charge a fee from the traveler and Local Cousins keep 70% of this fee. In essence, Your Local Cousin adds the most human element to travel planning communicating with an actual person who understands your interests and travel style. We want travelers to discover the world through the eyes of locals and visit the unique hidden gems that are often missed by review sites and travel forums.</p>
