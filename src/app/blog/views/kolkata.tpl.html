            <p align="justify">I have lived in Mumbai. I have lived in Delhi. I have also spent a significant amount of time in Southern India. Living in Calcutta though, changed me. For instance, it is here that I learned to avail and appreciate the public modes of transport from autos to buses to metros. If you've been a fairly spoiled brat like myself, you'd understand when I say it was a traumatic first experience. Eventually, I ceased to be afraid and embraced it instead.

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Calcuttans are trained to appreciate the finer things in life. They, and I can proudly say we, have found a way to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary and acquiesce the thrills in mundane. It may be as simple as popping puchkas outside Jadavpur University's Gate No 4. (Personally my favourite in terms of balanced flavours but Rainy Park puchka blew my mind, tasty and expensive!). Or listening to the odd Baul singing through the lanes of Salt Lake on the off chance that you were up at dawn. It could be the unexpected encounter with a delightful old man on the bus, who engages you in conversation on history and philosophy and leaves you feeling strange, in a good way.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Kz89kF0SQAeCScXTayeU" alt="Kolkata city tour, Kolkata tea trove">

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">And oh, the smell of New Market at 9 in the A.M when street hawkers are stretching themselves awake and shops are being swept before opening time. This Victorian Gothic market is a mini time capsule, taking you back when it was exclusively for the British, and closed to natives. Journeying from the suburbs in Salt Lake via the metro to Esplanade to buy one's groceries in New Market is indeed, quite thrilling.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">What a thriving community! Muslims and Anglo Indians, Churches and Mosques side by side. The bright terracotta bricks and old white buildings shine under the morning sun. This light washes over all of Lindsay Street illuminating every detail of life. The often barefooted hand-drawn rickshaw puller; the beggars and stray dogs having a quick splash under the hand pumps; and the sweepers, defying all odds imposed by strewn filth and garbage, sweeping away to their heart's content, within a 5 meter radius ofcourse. Thus, you enter Hogg's Market (aka New Market) vegetable and meat bazaar. My father always referred to it as 'Saahebder Bajaar'. I thought it was because of the English speaking coolies who offer their services to carry your grocery bags while you do your groceries. The history behind it though, is that back in the day the Caucasians were the 'Saaheb' (master).</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">Did I mention the delectable eateries found in nooks and crannies? My favourite spot is the Restaurant on the Rooftop. It goes by the name ‘<a href="https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/blue-and-beyond-new-market-area">Blue and Beyond</a>’. Calcutta's skyline never looked more charming from this age old rooftop, whilst sipping chilled beer. Off Lindsay Street you can find Kalman’s Meat Shop, a feast for the carnivores. Best cold cuts, sausages and Ox tongue (oh yeah!), hands down! It is unique and never have I eaten such sausages outside of Calcutta. And to my vegetarian friend, do not frown! To my surprise, Calcutta offers a greater range and number of vegetarian options than non vegetarian, if not the same! Bengali cuisine has a host of sophisticated ‘niramish’ (vegetarian) dishes that will surprise you. The core ingredients are exquisite spices and foliage. ‘Shukto’, ‘Aaloo-jheengey posto’, Mango Daal and Laal Saag (red spinach) are my top favourite meat-free dishes. These are light on the belly, refreshing to taste and yet bursting with unique flavours. Poppy seeds, mustard and ghee are the prime sources of flavor in this gravy based vegetable dish of bittergourd and pumpkin i.e Shukto. But you must get in touch with a local (like my cook, or myself!) to savor the various ‘jhols’ (water based, light gravies) you will find nowhere else but in Bengali homes.</p><br>
            <p align="justify">Calcutta’s biryaani is world famous. If it isn’t, it very well should be! Royal Biryani House is over a century old, located in central Calcutta. The other top biryani restaurants are over 30 years old at the very least! <a href="https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/shiraz-golden-restaurant-park-street-area">Shiraz</a>, <a href="https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/aminia-new-market-area">Aminia</a> and <a href="https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/zeeshan-park-circus-area">Zeeshan</a> are on the top of my list. Zeeshan is the winner for me. Remember, the recipes in these eateries date centuries back to the royal Mughal kitchens. Calcutta’s biryani is special for the incredible flavor of the potatoes used in it. <a href="https://www.zomato.com/ncr/kolkatas-royal-biryani-house-sohna-road-gurgaon">Royal Biryani House</a> is perhaps the only one which does not serve the potatoes…what?!</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">Oh yes, have I mentioned that the only way around New Market, (and in my view, most of Calcutta) is by foot? It is impossible to maneuver a vehicle in the market throngs. I suppose it makes sense having quenched one’s gustatory desires. Calcutta is one of the few cities where long walks are fun, especially under good weather. We cannot escape the grime or the stench of sewers or the nauseating odor of raw fish. I will tell you this, often it is worth subjecting your olfactory organs to this minor offense. Because when you find that park or merely the ‘gaacher tala’ (below the shade of a massive tree) by the tea shop, all your worries turn into a forgotten spec. The charm of this city lies in the tatterdemalion feel of it, delicate yet sturdy. You delight in tea and humorous conversations and this ‘adda’ can be spotted several times over on any street. I kid you not, Calcuttans do some epic rubbernecking. For no particular reason, we take pleasure in looking at aesthetically pleasing or even displeasing sights of people and things and loudly exclaim our approval or disdain.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Aooa19MLQWuzs1oTuwW0" alt="Sholo Ana Blue Poppy restaurants, Kolkata tourist map, Calcutta sightseeing and tourism">

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">The walk down Gariahat road has a most endearing surprise for any tourist. Every evening, rickshaw-wallas, taxi drivers, cops, shop keepers and the like can be found lined up beneath the Gariahat flyover, playing chess and carom. Or are seen clambering atop one another to frantically watch the cricket match on the singular compact telly, at one of the busiest crossings in South Calcutta!</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">So what is the cynosure of Calcutta? One might say St Paul’s cathedral on the last Sunday before Christmas. My Protestant friend who frowns upon religious activities, ensures that this one day in the year he makes it to the glorious St Paul’s Church. He says it is a ceremonious service and rather enjoyable. Remember, not Christmas but the last Sunday before Christmas! </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">One might say Central Avenue and North Calcutta for its tremendous architecture. Some might say the Royal Calcutta Golf Club for one of the best golf courses in the country as well as Asia. Or the opulent festivities and colossal crowds during Durga Pooja or Christmas and ‘…wait for it…’ Chinese New Year! Tangra (China town of Calcutta) goes the whole hog. How many cities in India have a thriving Chinese community? Good old fashioned Indian Chinese people are great fun! Chinese New Year is celebrated with the Dragon Dance that leads the entire community, marching down the lanes of every lane in Tangra, celebrating and praying for protection at every doorstep. Also, Tangra has the best blend of Indian - Chinese food and Tangra made this its business USP! But for me, the cynosures of Calcutta are the roads less travelled, the parks and old deserted bungalows, the elderly men and women and the fragrance of the ‘Bakul gaach’ . The serenity I experience in this quaint old city makes me forget all its shortcomings.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">P.S. Evidently, I cannot stop suggesting Calcutta’s culinary celebrations. We often need to rehydrate and refuel our bodies in this sultry city, especially after those long walks. Here’s a quick list of popular outlets to kick back at and enjoy a budget meal that stands out! Traditional sweets and snacks are best located in North Calcutta. These are most unique in this part of town although you will find several shops at every other corner selling the famous chops and cutlets.</p>
