            <p align="justify">Mike and Regina van de Velden quit their jobs in New Zealand and started their "Walk the Earth" journey in January 2014. Even though they loved their jobs in the entertainment industry they knew there was something more to life than working 10 -16 hour days. It was only that desire to live while they're alive that drove them to find a way to live "free". By <i>living "free"</i> they intended to live a flexible life doing the things they love and spending more time with the people they love. With absolutely no prior experience they learned how to take full advantage of the digital economy and run an online business. They now teach thousands of people around the world how to live the way they do and also help small businesses how to gain more online exposure. And they do all this while they’re on the road, traveling the world!</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> What made you and Mike quit your glamorous jobs in the entertainment industry to travel full time?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> I think the idea of having a glamorous job is just that - an idea. No matter how fun and exciting your job is, in the end choosing what's best for you to live a life of happiness is ideal. We loved our jobs because we had fun for a while, we got paid well and we were around cool people, but in the end it was just a job. We were getting tired of working 50-100 hour work weeks. We were burnt out. We were letting life pass us by.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>


             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> Did you plan ahead before you finally took the leap of faith?</p>
                <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> Not really. You can plan so much when you're considering traveling with no return ticket. We made sure we had a bit of a buffer in our savings just in case running an online business wouldn't work out. We only decided to leave two months before we actually did. That meant packing up and storing our stuff from one house and renting out two houses. All we really did was pick a couple of destinations and went for it.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>


             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> How did your family and friends react when you told them about your decision?</p>
                <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> When we made the decision to leave, our friends and family were excited for us. They were also very confused. They couldn't figure out how we were doing it, why we were doing it and if we'd actually last. Our immediate family was very supportive and happy for us.</p>
             <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> What factors do you consider when planning your next destination and how do you go about planning where to stay, what to do and basically how to get the most out of your time in that country?</p>
                <div class="space20"></div>
             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> This is an interesting question because for the most part it really depends what's going on in our lives. For the first couple years, every three months we had an event to attend somewhere in the States, so we mostly traveled around that. We also traveled based on special events going on in friend's lives too, for example we went to our friend's circus wedding in Canada, another wedding in Mexico. We had friends in Costa Rica and Panama so we visited them. I think the only place we really went to that had nothing to do with friends is <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Prague-CzechRepublic">Prague</a>, Czech Republic.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">As far as figuring out where we wanted to stay, we either stayed with friends, found apartments locally or used websites like AirBnB. A lot of times the good deals aren't listed on any website. It helps to know people in the area or at least meet people in the area. In Bali for example you literally just start asking locals. Because someone may know someone who knows 'a guy' to help you get what you want. It's quite interesting and fun.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">We love <i>living like</i> a local. This means we like to find apartments or villas in a neighborhood or building where the locals live. One of the first things we do is look for a grocery store so that we can make food at home even if the cost of eating out is cheap in an area. It's just a good habit to pick up because you end up saving money doing other things later on.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">A lot of times we'll go to a city and do city bus tours if they have it (or something similar). This allows us to see all parts of the city at once. If we're staying a bit longer this gives us the chance to pick our favorite area and go back later so that we can spend more time there. This also gives us the chance to take a ton of photos and videos for our blog and YouTube channel.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> Assuming you travel light, what are the absolute essentials you carry and would recommend others do when they embark on a journey similar to yours?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong>Great question! We definitely travel lighter and lighter. It's so hard because even though we travel with less clothes, for some reason we keep picking up more electronics to supplement our media production. I would definitely recommend the following:</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Dry bags (we've traveled to so many tropical places that this is one of the handiest items)</p>

             <p align="justify"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Locks for your bags and a lightweight cable lock to tie around all your bags. This is useful if you fall asleep in the airport or even if you go somewhere (like swimming) and are alone because you can lock your stuff onto something.</p>

             <p align="justify"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Snacks in case you can't find any food near by</p>

             <p align="justify"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Extra cash in an inside pocket or a thin bag you can stick under your clothes</p>

             <p align="justify"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>A book or something to keep you busy.</p>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> Many would say "I need to be pretty well off to be able to travel for so long!". Would be great for our readers to know how you're able to financially sustain yourself on the road for so long?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> This is the biggest fallacy ever. Especially if you plan to travel slow. In fact, we spend way less when we travel for several reasons: we have limited space and weight for our bags, we'd rather spend money on experiences than material goods, we're not paying for our mortgage, any insurances except travel (which is cheap), we're mindful of what we purchase. Sometimes there are items that you just can't get in certain places so you have to make sure certain things last a bit longer. For example, face lotion or even articles of clothing. There are many ways you can cut or repurpose costs for your travels. You learn to become creative as you move around. I'm lucky in that my sister runs a clothing line (<a href="http://www.shopunveiled.com/">Unveiled Collection</a>) and the designs she has are conducive to traveling. They're cute, easy to wear, I can mix and match, they don't wrinkle and I can roll them up small. As far as longer term expenses, Mike and I run an online business. We also teach and speak at events all over the world. We teach others how to live as a "FreedomPreneur" or a digital nomad. We also teach small businesses how to get more online exposure for their business.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">Another fallacy is believing that you can't go anywhere because you have a mortgage to pay. We had two and still left within two months. There are ways to solve any problem you have, you just have to find it. You can't let your mind limit you to think something is not possible. <i>Anything is possible</i>.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> Can you tell us more about <i>'FreedomPreneur'</i> and what it takes to become one?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> Absolutely. It all really started when I realized that I didn't want to work for the rest of my life. I was in New Zealand working in the film industry and I had no time to make friends outside of work. I was also missing my family back in California. I really wanted to be able to have the flexibility to do what I wanted and spend time with the people I love.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">I read the "<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/">Four Hour Work Week</a>" by Tim Ferriss and found mentors who were already doing what I wanted to do maybe not necessarily traveling full time (I didn't realize that's what I wanted to do at the time), but creating an income in such a way that it allowed them to travel.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">I didn't coin the term "FreedomPreneur", my mentors spearheaded this movement which has been snowballing the past few years. But, we've been very active in the movement and have a deep passion for showing others that it can be done and teaching those who want to learn. What it really is all about is learning to find out what your form of freedom is and basically learning how to monetize your passion. This is a hard concept to understand for most people because its just so new even though more and more people are doing it. It really took a lot of personal development and 'finding myself' to shift from the employee to entrepreneur mindset, but doing this really changed my life. This concept of freedom changed drastically when I realized that there is so much opportunity in the new digital economy. In the end, 'freedom' is whatever you want it to be. We all talk about having to make money and we think that's what it's all about, but it's really just having the means to be able to do the things we want, when we want, with whom we want.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">To become a FreedomPreneur you have to have the desire to work on yourself first through personal development. You can do this through reading books, listening to audio and continuously work to be a better person. It's the perfect moment to expand your mind and be open to new things, work through your limitations and grow mentally, emotionally, spiritually. To become a <a href="http://freedompreneur-secret.com/">FreedomPreneur</a> you also have to want to continuously learn and implement new things. I know a lot of this might be hard to grasp, but I guarantee once you start getting into Napolean Hill, Tony Robbins, Bob Proctor, Stephen Covey, Dale Carnegia, Earl Nightingale and other similar thought leaders... you'll start to understand. If you've reached that point already then you can message us personally at vdv@courageouslyfree.com. Otherwise, I wouldn't even bother until you've fully worked on yourself. I'm saying this because it's not an easy journey, but it's well worth it.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> How many countries have you visited since January 2014 and what places are you visiting in the year ahead?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> We've only been to about 15 or so countries and did a cross country RV trip from <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/LosAngeles-CA-USA">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Orlando-FL-USA">Orlando</a>. This isn't much compared to other avid travelers, but we do travel slow. In the year ahead we intend to visit the Philippines, <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Dubai-UnitedArabEmirates">Dubai</a>, Australia and New Zealand. We have a gap of about 3 months that we're trying to figure out what to do. We would like to do Europe again, but we'll see how it goes. We are anticipating slowing down even more once we get to New Zealand so that we can make it our home base again. We want to start traveling differently. We want to have a home base and work our buns off and then leave for a month or two and purely travel. At the moment we work wherever we go and we find that we miss out on a lot of gems that each location has to offer.</p>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> Tell us about your most memorable experiences from your travels thus far. Experiences that have made you appreciate what you have more than you did before you started your journey.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> We've had so many memorable experiences by far, but to date, the one that stands out happened 9 months before we even started our "Walk the Earth" journey. Mike and I had our first major travel trip together in early 2013. It all started when we were talking about dreams and for some reason Mount Everest came up. I was a bit surprised, not because this was a dream of Mike's, but the fact that he shot down the dream pretty quickly because of the costs involved.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify">I think so many of us do that. I do to an extent as well, but I also think that if there's something you really want then you'll do anything to get it. Anyway, this must have been on my mind because not too long after I found a deal online to do a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (EBC). It was so cheap! It wasn't a summit trek, but considering our experience (or lack thereof) it was a great start. I purchased a spot to do the trek and told Mike so he can get his. It was exciting to be able to prep for this huge journey. It was a 13 day trek with 13 other Aussies and Kiwis. We went on the trek and got really sick. It wasn't the altitude; it was the food or water. So of the 9 day ascent I was sick for 6 days and Mike was sick for 8. We barely ate and even if we did, the food went straight through either end.</p>
            <div class="space10"></div>

            <figcaption>
                <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/SPYEIRBWRyjXvvF3IzY1" alt="Mount Everest North/South Base Camp in Khumbu Nepal">
                <figcaption>Mike and Regina ‘keeping it fit’ on their way to Everest Base Camp</figcaption>
            </figcaption>
            <div class="space10"></div>

             <p align="justify">Imagine walking 6-8 hours a day (a 200 meter vertical ascent) on barely any food and having to answer nature's call more than you'd like. It was not easy. There was a point where I asked Mike "Should we just stop. Are you ok?" We were two days away from Base Camp. We figured, we've come so far, why stop now. On the last day of ascent we stopped at Gorak Shep, which was the last lodge before descending. We stopped there to drop our things off before going to the actual Base Camp to acclimatize. Acclimatizing just means that you hike high and sleep low so that your body can recover faster. We still had 2 more hours to go even though we already hiked 8 hours earlier. This was Mike's worst day. I was already feeling better, but his pain was excruciating. Each step hurt him so much.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
             <p align="justify">We finally got to Base Camp (incidentally, we only stayed there for about 30 minutes) and Mike fell to his knees because his stomach was so bad. He looked up as I stood next to him and he unexpectedly said the 4 words most women want to hear: "Will you marry me?"</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
             <p align="justify">I thought he was joking because it was such an odd moment. So I laughed. A few minutes later as I was taking my gloves off he said, "Now I can give you your ring that you're taking your glove off." "Oh! You were serious?" I asked. Well needless to say, I did say yes.</p>

            <div class="space10"></div>

            <div class="space10"></div>

             <p align="justify">Now, the biggest thing I took away from this entire experience was that each and every one of us has so many untapped resources. We don't realize how much more power we have until we get to a point where we need it. And in that we grow even more. The fact that we went up the largest mountain range on barely any food, for an average of 7 hours a day was an eye opener. Even after all of that I think I could have gone even further. I've learned that I have to trust myself more and always keep on going towards my end goal even if I feel uncomfortable.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal:</strong> What advice would you give to a likeminded couple who is planning to quit their jobs and travel the world?</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <p align="justify"><strong>Regina:</strong> If you don't plan to go back to a job, find a way to create an income that can help sustain your travels. Please do NOT quit right away. Make sure that your source of income is consistent and have a bit of a buffer when you leave. Think of some cool skills that you might have too. I have friends who have been able to use various skills for local jobs in the area they are visiting.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
             <p align="justify">Last, but not least, know that anything you want to do is possible. Instead of having a dream and immediately shooting it down because you can't do it right now, find a way to make it happen. For example instead of thinking “I want to travel the world... but I can't because it's too expensive or I have no money” ask yourself "How CAN I find a way to travel?" Learning to ask productive questions triggers your subconscious to start seeking answers. And in that you'll notice that more and more clues as to how you can actually solve your problem will start popping up</p>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Kunal Jain</strong> -  Kunal’s deep love for travel led to him to create <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/">Your Local Cousin</a>. He has worked, lived and studied in seven cities across three continents and as a result he can bust out his German while drinking craft beer in NYC, find the best street food in Singapore, track elephants in the jungles of South India and drive through the insane traffic in Agra, his hometown.</a></p>

            <p align="justify"><strong>Regina van de Velden</strong> Regina is from the United States and along with her husband Mike who is from New Zealand, they left their comfy jobs to travel full time and have been doing so since 2014. They’ve been very successful at creating a really cool lifestyle around their passions and because they believe anything is possible, they inspire others to figure out what freedom means to them and take the leap to be courageously free in all areas of their lives. You can follow their story by visiting their <a href="http://travel.courageouslyfree.com/">blog</a> and also watch some amazing footage on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/courageouslyfreevdv">Youtube</a> channel.</a></p>
