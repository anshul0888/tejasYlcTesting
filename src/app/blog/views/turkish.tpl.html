            <p align="justify">My husband & I had been tossing around the idea of going on a Cruise for the past few years. This summer we came across a schedule that suited us perfectly. The <a href="http://www.celebritycruises.com/ships">Celebrity Fleet’s</a> “Equinox” would be departing via the Piraeus port in <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Athens-Greece">Athens</a> to the gorgeous Santiorini Island, the festive <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Mikonos84600-Greece">Mykonos</a> Island & the historic Rhodes Island. It would then head to the Kusadasi port in Turkey and end its journey at Istanbul. Having had a wonderful experience in Turkey in the past, the idea of going again came as a welcome bonus. It was only after we had the ship-cabins and airline tickets booked that we found out the Equinox would no longer be cruising all the way to Istanbul but instead its last stop was near Izmir in Turkey. Since our plans were already chalked out, we decided that after the Greek Islands we would still follow our original itinerary and make our way to Istanbul from where we would fly back to our final destination.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <h3 class="fmob-sub space20"><a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Izmir-%C4%B0zmir-Turkey">IZMIR</a></h3>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">After sailing through the Greek islands, we had a smooth check-out from the ship & by afternoon were having steaming cappuccinos in a busy street in Izmir, an hour away from our port of disembarkation. Our domestic flight to Istanbul was the following day, which left us with plenty of time to explore the city. Since the <a href="http://www.tourmakerturkey.com/kemeralti-mall.html">Kermalati Bazaar</a> shuts down at sun-set, it became our first stop. More of a local market, we knew from our previous visit that it did not rival Istanbul’s famous Grand Bazaar. Nevertheless from handicrafts such as the ‘evil-eye’ to whirling dervish statues, you can find everything here and at a better price too.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">We spent an hour wandering through the bazaar and then walked out towards Konak Meydani Square down Ataturk Avenue. Located near it is Asansor, often referred to as ‘The Elevator’. It is a historical building in the Karatas quarters boasting beautiful views of the cornice. The sea and the city stretched out for miles beneath us and in comparison to Greece, the vastness and population of Turkey suddenly seemed even more apparent.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">We had already decided that dinner would be by the sea-side area of Kordon in Izmir Bay. It is a charming place lined with cafes and restaurants and endearing horse-carriages. We grabbed a taxi and headed to the promenade. Instantly we noticed that the stone pavement reserved for pedestrians and horses had now given way to locals driving around in fancy German cars. Kordon it seemed was now to Izmir, what <a href="http://www.thewalkdubai.com/">JBR</a> walk is to <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Dubai-UnitedArabEmirates">Dubai</a>. The night was abuzz with conversation, car horns, music and laughter. Drained after a long day, we fell asleep as soon as we got back to our hotel.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Tomorrow we would be in the legendary city that bridges Asia with Europe and many cultures together.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <h3 class="fmob-sub space20"><a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Istanbul-%C4%B0stanbul-Turkey">ISTANBUL</a></h3>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">This land has been home to sultans and clerics, poets and architects, facts and fables. As our flight made its final descent I looked out at the sparkling blue water below us. Soon the hundreds of Istanbul minarets adorning the hills came into sight and we buckled up for landing.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">If you are not in the sky then one of the best places to view the city is from the <a href="http://www.greatistanbul.com/galata_tower.html">Galata Tower</a> / Galata Kulesi. The 360 degree observation walkway is narrow and rife with tourists but the sights it offers are worth all the hassle. Getting to Topkapi Palace or Seraglio, the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia (also known as the Church of the Holy Wisdom) in one panoramic frame is the definitive goal of most tourists.</p>

                <figcaption>Galata Tower</figcaption>
            </figcaption>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">We spent an hour up there just taking in the glorious scenery. Being in this area it was guaranteed that next we would be going down <a href="http://www.istanbultrails.com/2008/11/how-istiklal-caddesi-became-istanbuls-most-famous-and-fashionable-street/">Istiklal Caddesi /Avenue</a>; the street that seamlessly blends in the past with the present. Cafes of all sizes can be found on both sides here and tucked in between them are local shops selling all kinds of Turkish products. Off late well-known brands like <a href="http://www.sephora.com/">Sephora or Mango</a> have also occupied expensive real estate space on this historic street. Many alleys on the street lead towards <a href="http://www.hammamguide.com/">hamams</a>, bars or <a href="http://young.scot/choices-for-life/articles/what-is-shisha-smoking/">sheesha</a> cafes and the movement of the red trams always generates excitement. </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">We were in search of some authentic <a href="http://turkishfood.about.com/od/KebabsGrill/tp/The-Five-Most-Popular-Turkish-Kebabs.htm">Turkish kebap</a> and ended up at a restaurant with spacious outdoor seating. The garden fans were not the best but the enthusiasm of the waiter and the anticipation of the food kept us upbeat. Generous servings of all kinds of Kebap, grilled vegetables and Turkish rice soon were laid out on our table. The meal was delicious and friendly on the pocket. It is only when we were almost done that my eyes fell upon the television. I could vaguely make out a bridge on the screen, red lights flashing on it. There seemed to be some sort of a hold up. I put down my drink and tried to get a closer look. <a href="http://www.cnnturk.com/"><i>CNN Turk</i></a> was on and I was looking at the Bosphorus! Unfortunately, we reside in a precarious and volatile world these days and my gut said something terrible had happened. I tried to dismiss the thoughts taking me to the events that occurred at Istanbul airport just a month ago. </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>“Closed!” the waiter was looking at me now.</b></p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>“What is closed?” I asked. He shrugged and repeated “Closed.”</b></p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>My blank expression made him add “Bridge. Everything. Closed.”</b></p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">The <a href="http://www.greatistanbul.com/golden_horn.html">Golden Horn</a> waterway is a horn-shaped estuary that flows into the Bosphorus strait and separates the newer side of Istanbul that we were in from the older which is where our hotel was. Although we were still in the European half of the city, in order to get back we would need to cross over this body of water, which meant having to cross a bridge. My husband’s eyes reflected my thoughts; we were on the wrong side of the city! By now all the recent unfortunate world incidents were playing in my head like a slideshow. Instinct told us to ask questions later and to get out of the restaurant first. This sudden realization brought us to our feet and we immediately asked for the bill.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">If you are walking from the Galata tower then the Istikilal street leads you into the renowned <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/reclaiming-of-istanbuls-taksim-square-by-erdogan-supporters-sparks-trepidation-in-some-quarters-1469189170">Taksim Square</a> / Meydani of Istanbul.  The corner of Taksim where just an hour ago there had been many vehicles now had only three taxis. Groups of tourists were haggling with the drivers while others were briskly walking back to their hotels. The first driver simply refused to take us or anyone anywhere. The second driver offered to take us for 400 Liras, an exorbitant amount. The third driver was also denying service but when we told him our destination was not nearby but in Laleli Fatih, he told us to get in the car. The excited, anxious voice of a radio presenter blared in the taxi. Several times we could make out the word “Erdogan”. </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>“Country okay?”</b> my husband asked.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>“No. not okay!”</b> replied the driver. His nervous voice betrayed his otherwise calm demeanor <b>“Army now. Erdogan gone.”</b></p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">Confusion took over my concern. In the hour that we had been busy chewing on food, had the country suddenly undergone some sort of a civil change? We had just begun to consider this notion of a coup when our car got onto the bridge. While our path towards old Istanbul was in the clear, the one going towards new Istanbul had been blocked by security personal and that entire side of the bridge now stood in a deadlock. It was only later that it dawned on us that historically whenever there has been a protest in the city it has been around the <a href="https://www.internations.org/places/view/taksim-republic-monument-24095">Republic Monument</a> located in Taksim square. Whoever was in charge did not want public going in that direction!</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">We successfully crossed the bridge and our car soon reached the <a href="http://www.livius.org/articles/place/constantinople-istanbul/constantinople-photos/constantinople-aqueduct-of-valens/?">Valens Aquaduct</a> or Bozdogan Kemeri, which has been a landmark of the city since the Roman times of Constantinople. As soon as we passed through its arches, there was chaos everywhere. No one was following the rules. The efforts of the pedestrians to get taxis seemed to be in vain. Our driver meandered his way through this disorder and kept driving forward until suddenly the car came to a stop. </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"><b>“Now walk”</b> said the driver. Surely, he was not serious. We didn’t even know where we were or how far we would have to go. Our protests fell on deaf ears. As we got off the car he said: <b>“You lucky I take you tonight.”</b> Still a little bewildered, we began our walk in the general direction that he had pointed us in. The city seemed darker. We could not really make out where we were going. It was not long before we were stopped by a soldier. <b>“Stop.”</b> That’s all I remember him saying because the second soldier across the street was shouting at a group of locals. If we needed proof of a coup here it was. The Army really had taken over. We turned around and quickened our pace in the hope that we would find the right way. There were still many people out on the road but there was a sense of urgency in the air now. A tourist stopped me to ask for directions. The language barrier made it difficult to converse but we both carried that same sentiment of just wanting to get back to our hotel as fast as we could. </p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Up until now the information we had was limited and a lack of facts was adding to the anxiety. When we reached a major junction on the road, we found groups of locals shouting in Turkish. There seemed to be no presence of any police around and there was a lot of commotion all over the place. In fact we realized that we had not seen any sort of local law enforcement in all this time. The Army soldiers with guns in hands were standing in different corners of the road. Perhaps we were near some important political landmark but in the dim lights it was hard to make out. Fortunately, we had our hotel map with us and found local Samaritans who helped us navigate our way. That night we walked just a couple of kilometers to reach the hotel but at that time it felt like eternity. </p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Back at the hotel, some of the guests had gathered in the lobby around a television. A guest tried to find an English channel but soon gave up. The hotel staff did not offer any comforting words except that we need not worry. It was clear that they were as clueless as we were. A few guests went out and bought essential grocery items from a small shop a few meters away. We deliberated getting some Turkish Liras out of the ATM for emergency purposes but then abandoned that idea when the receptionist asked us to get back to the rooms because there was news of Army personnel patrolling the streets and that not only helicopters but also Air-force planes were in the air. Clearly it was not advisable to venture out of the hotel at all.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">A lot happened in the hours that followed. The airport was shutdown. Video clips from protests in Ankara and Istanbul made their rounds on social media. The people had heard their President and had come out onto the streets. Next day, it was confirmed that the army had not succeeded and the previous order had been restored. Next day, it was confirmed that the army had not succeeded and the previous order had been restored. In the morning a big bus carrying tourists parked itself on the corner of our street. Outside, the passengers from the bus were getting their luggage out. They told us they were supposed to be here last night but were stuck at the airport. Staying indoors was getting cumbersome so we decided to take a short walk to gauge the situation. A few of the shops had started opening up by now and newspapers were selling like hot cakes. Not having had breakfast we stepped into a corner roadside café. The owner seemed to be in a grumpy mood, he was ready for business but his otherwise busy place was empty.</p>

            <p align="justify">Initially our plan for the day had been to stroll around <a href="http://www.yourlocalcousin.com/">Sultanahmet Fatih</a> (heart of historic old Istanbul) and at night to attend a Turkish cultural show and dinner. Instead, we decided take an early ride back to the airport. Despite this well thought out strategy, the scenes on the road that followed surpassed our expectations.  </p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">Men, women, children, senior citizens, everyone was on the streets waving the Turkish flag. In the past 24 hours the atmosphere had changed from scary to jubilant. There was a large crowd in front of the Istanbul Police Department because they, the people had protected their democracy. Our journey to the airport was supposed to take thirty minutes and although we had left hours earlier our chances of reaching the airport on time seemed unlikely. The bus driver honked at the crowd a few times which made things worse. People started hitting the bus with their hands instead. At that point we opened the front door of our vehicle and bought Turkish flag from a vendor. We needed to reassure the masses that we harboured no ill-will and the crowds seemed to approve this gesture. Not only did the public applaud this move but also took selfies with a bus full of tourists. </p>

            <p align="justify">We crawled through this red and white sea for nearly four hours. The Ataturk Airport had been taken over by the military the night before and anticipated that their absence was going to be rejoiced here as well. Before the terminal entrances on either side were scores of people with flags and banners. There was no sign of any security and we saw passengers and flight attendants get out of their vehicles and walk with luggage in hand to the terminal. Upon entering the airport we saw weary passengers on the floor whose flights had been cancelled or delayed. Once our flight took off, that aura of restlessness remained with us. It was only upon reaching our transit in Bahrain that it felt like we had gone through the <i>“Looking Glass”</i> and entered another dimension. Here, all was calm and quiet. We had finally left the uncertainty and thrill of Istanbul far behind us.</p>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify">I am glad I was able to grab this packet of Turkish delights before leaving. It is a reminder of the good time we did have there. The city has been home to many historical events and this time around looks like we were smack down in the middle of one as it unfolded. News today had snippets of a potential state of emergency being declared in the country. I would advise all those travelling there to stay alert and to packs lots of patience with them. The Turkish people always seem like a friendly lot and I hope their country regains its peace and stability.  Despite everything, Istanbul remains one of my favorite tourist destinations. </p>
