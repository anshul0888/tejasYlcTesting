                Three hours in Georgetown, D.C. like a local . . .  and then Some
            </h2>

            <div class="space20"></div>


            <p align="justify">Me and my co-founder, Kunal, headed down to <a href="http://washington.org/">Washington D.C.</a> for a few days on a mini road-trip and wanted to explore the city through the eyes of locals.  We stayed with my cousin, (super amazeballs host) Nupur, who lives in Adam’s Morgan and who is very in touch with all the cool, hip bars and restaurants in town.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">One day we had three hours to kill and decided to head over to <a href="http://www.georgetowndc.com/">Georgetown</a> – with absolutely no plan in mind! We decided to see this part of town in a new way – by asking locals what their favorite places are and following everyone’s advice!  Now for anyone who knows me, they know I’m a crazy planner.  I plan all my meals, know every dish I’m going to order and map out my vacation days to the ‘T’, so this was certainly a new experience for me – and I have to say I loved it!  Here is what happened:</p>

             <h3 class="fmob-sub">1) <a href="http://www.opencitydc.com/">Open City</a>:</h3>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/mfkeZGwlTrqAtMo7Tr1R" alt="Open City Restaurant Menu, Georgetown, Washington DC">
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <p align="justify"> We started out late in the day and decided to head for brunch close by in Adams Morgan to Open City, suggested by my cousin Nupur.  This large, bright restaurant made me feel like I was in a Latin club where salsa dancers would magically appear given the lively music.  They had several seating options including a cool air-conditioned dining room, an outdoor patio and seating under a canopy.  They also have extensive menu offerings including Classic American fare with a touch of French that will please almost everyone and they serve breakfast at all hours (including several Bloody Mary selections).  We started our meal with an Iced Chai Latte and an Iced Cappuccino, which were both served with ANIMAL CRACKERS!!! It was a bit of a sugar bomb but very tasty and the cookies were a little added surprise! I ordered the Chicken & Guac Burger with a side of fries and this was honestly one of the best chicken burgers I’ve ever had.  It was tender, flavorful and very juicy, served with onions, a garlicky aioli, tomato and lettuce on a potato bun – fresh and excellent!  Kunal had the Albermarle sandwich with turkey, brie, green apple and cranberry mayo.  Both great choices and I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/open-city-washington">Open City</a> for families with small kids given the extensive menu offerings and spacious seating.</p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">2) Georgetown Waterfront Park:</h3>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/piB0WQVwT6S08p0cSA2y" alt="Potomac River Waterfront Park, Georgetown, Washington">
            <div class="space20"></div>


            <p align="justify">After fueling up and hydrating for the 90+ degree heat we hopped in a taxi and told our driver, David, to take us to “his favorite part of Georgetown” and gave him no other directions or address.  David, a Nigeria native who called Washington D.C. his home for the past 10 years, was loquacious and told us that he loves the <a href="http://www.georgetownwaterfrontpark.org/">Waterfront Park</a> because it’s a peaceful escape from the city.  Even though it feels a bit touristy a lot of people work in this area so happy hours are great as well.  Taking his advice Kunal and I strolled along the beautiful Waterfront Park for 15 minutes, admiring the paddle-boarders with strong abs along the Potomac River and feeling jealous of the small kids running through the fountains as we were dripping sweat.</p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">3) C&O Canal, Blues Alley and the “Haagen Daz Map”</h3>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/s2wl8KpRxGsBbJ60F8AQ" alt="C&O Canal Trail Towpath, Georgetown">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">From the Waterfront Park we started walking towards the famous <a href="http://maps.georgetown.edu/3307mstreetnw/">M Street</a>, well known by tourists for its designer shops – but we really wanted something more authentic.  We met Jerry (who was sitting and texting) along the <a href="http://bikewashington.org/canal/">C&O Canal</a> and asked him what he loves to do in the area.  Jerry is an Arizona native who made Washington D.C. his home 10 years ago and he was more than happy to advise us on what to do next. Based on his advice, Kunal and I walked along the beautiful C&O Canal.  It turns out that Georgetown was a tobacco port until the mid 19th century and due to natural obstructions, the C&O Canal was later used to transport goods 180 miles towards Western Maryland. Much of the pathway along the canal in Georgetown remains intact and is popular with bicyclists and nature-lovers who want to escape the commercial vibe of the surrounding areas.  It made for a peaceful walk with historic buildings lining the path.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">We then strolled down “<a href="http://www.bluesalley.com/">Blues Alley</a>” a narrow alleyway (under construction), tucked behind a sushi restaurant.  Apparently the jazz club, Blues Alley Jazz, is a buzzing nightspot for hardcore jazz fans.  This club and restaurant was opened in 1965 and its walls have heard the sounds of Charlie Byrd, Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis and McCoy Tyner, to name a few jazz legends.  Acts are booked 360 nights out of the year and this is an impressive date spot!</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify">Jerry also told us about the “Haagen Daz” map. We thought he was a little out of his mind for telling us to visit a <a href="http://www.georgetowndc.com/explore/dining/haagen-dazs-3120-m-st-nw/">Haagen Daz</a> to get a glimpse of how to experience Georgetown like a local– but we were wrong!  Inside the Haagen Daz on M Street is a beautifully pained map in a lot of detail that showcases where the historic hotspots in Georgetown are located.  As a result we ventured to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olst/index.htm">The Old Stone House</a>, the only surviving pre-revolutionary structure in the nation’s capital(and apparently haunted by a murderous misogynist) and several other historic sites. </p>
            <div class="space20"></div>
             <h3 class="fmob-sub">4) <a href="http://www.citytavernclubdc.org/">The City Tavern</a></h3>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/UnvRFfceRUmVBhkwWMjt" alt="The City Tavern Club, Georgetown, Washington">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            While strolling down M Street and being consumed by retailers that were better suited for a suburban mall atmosphere, a beautiful historic building stood out, sandwiched between a BCBG Max Azria and a Banana Republic.  Turns out The City Tavern, built in 1796, is listed on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/">National Register of Historic Places</a> and is now home to the ultra-exclusive, members-only <a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/08/exclusive-places-in-washington-dc-youll-never-get-into/the-national-republican-club-of-capitol-hill">City Tavern Club.</a> It is also one of the only private clubs in the United States organized for the purpose of preserving an historic building.</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

            <p align="justify"><b><u>How did we get a private tour you ask!</u></b> We rang the buzzer and a young man named Quinn Glass graciously offered us a peek inside of this historic relic (since it was August and closed for the month to members anyway).  Quinn is a Tyler, Texas native who moved to Georgetown for college, and has lived in Washington D.C. for the past seven years working for the City Tavern Club.  He told us the building served many of the founding fathers – <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/georgewashington">George Washington</a> was on the Board of the Bank of Columbia next door, and the Tavern has close associations with <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/john-adams-37967">John and Samuel Adams</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/thomas-jefferson-brief-biography">Thomas Jefferson</a> (there is even a handwritten dinner invitation from Abigail Adams in the Receiving Room).  Housed inside the building is a majestic ball room, “The Great Hall”, originally a courtyard and livery stable and also where <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/lyndon-b-johnson">Lyndon B</a>. Johnson held a reception for his daughter upon her engagement to future <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/14/us/after-six-years-of-scandal-senator-seeks-redemption.html">Senator Chuck Robb</a>.  We viewed twelve rooms in total and the house is in great shape with many features left in tact since its construction including its floorboards, the downstairs tavern and paintings.  Touring The City Tavern was a real treat and provided a beautiful glimpse into the past and a great respite from the commercialism outdoors.​</p>
            <div class="space20"></div>

             <h3 class="fmob-sub">5) <a href="http://www.cadysalley.com/">Cady’s Alley</a> and <a href="Washington D.C.">Leopold Café:</a></h3>

            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/040xBo3mQVubh7ho34Sp" alt="Leopold cafe/kafe/bar menu, Georgetown">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            For our next stop we approached Lydia (who was also texting while on a bench), a Forest Hills, New York transplant who has been living and working in the Georgetown area for the past two years.  Lydia was extremely friendly and urged us to visit <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/destination-design-the-high-end-home-furnishings-on-georgetowns-cadys-alley/2013/09/24/1b0efe20-0e7e-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html">Cady’s Alley</a>, one of the most stylish backstreets in Georgetown, housing some of the most upscale interior designers and paved with granite Belgian blocks.  Apparently this once-dicey 19th-Century alleyway was used for shuttling the laundry of Washington’s upper crust. Lucky for us this hidden alleyway is now also home to Kafe Leopold, an Austrian café with an extensive brunch, sandwich, pastry, coffee and wine menu.  The café is bright and ultra-modern, attracting a Euro-chic crowd sipping white wine and noshing on frites on a late afternoon.  Kunal and I were in need of cool refreshments and Kafe Leopold delivered with their house-made minty lemonade and iced tea – very refreshing and not too sweet.  Our gracious waitress, Sylvia, urged us to try the baked chocolate mousse with a dollop of coffee ice cream and it was just the boost of sugar we needed to regain our energy from the sweltering heat.  We loved that Kafe Leopold is tucked away in this cool back-alley but come here because the food is high quality and</p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">6) <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/07/exorcist-40th-anniversary/2764565/">The Exorcist Stairs:</a></h3>
            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ggkX8z3vRsyVg1Xzbs7j" alt="The Exorcist Stairs, Georgetown">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            Ever since reading the “Haagen Daz map” of historic places (mentioned above) Kunal wanted to visit the “Exorcist stairs”, the stone steps at the corner of Prospect St NW and 36th St NW leading down to M Street.  In the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/"><em>The Exorcist</em></a>, the stairs were padded with ½ inch-thick rubber to film the death of the character Father Karras.  The stuntman fell down the stairs twice and Georgetown University students charged spectators $5 to view the stunt from their rooftops.  However, on our visit to Georgetown finding these stairs was a bit of a challenge so Kunal and I followed Maria, a resident tour guide and a group of 30 tourists to find them!  They were steep but clearly a very cool attraction.</p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">7) <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu">Georgetown University:</a></h3>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Uios5Bk3QMqIumzjgxyv" alt="Georgetown university graduate school programs/degree, Washington">
            <div class="space20"></div>

            Kunal and I ended our tour of Georgetown at the famed university – which is absolutely stunning.  <a href="http://guevents.georgetown.edu/healy_hall#.Vd5r3tNViko">Healy Hall</a> is the historic flagship building constructed in 1877 in the neo-medieval style.  Healy Hall was designed by Paul Pelz and John L. Smithmeyer at the same time they were working on the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  We walked through the beautiful building and admired the interior architecture as well as the famed library.  It was the perfect ending to three hours in Georgetown just before the much-needed downpour. </p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">8) <a href="http://www.compassrosedc.com/">Compass Rose:</a></h3>

            <div class="space20"></div>
            <img class="img-responsive blog-img" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kJYj4qSsSWSKeZ8vbyjj" alt="Compass Rose Bar and Kitchen, Washington Restaurant ">
            <div class="space20"></div>


            For dinner Nupur suggested Compass Rose a neighborhood tavern off 14th Street with a focus on eclectic international street food.  Owner, Rose Privite traveled to over 30 countries with her husband from 2009 – 2012 and decided to create a collection of recipes from foods she loved most. The result is an ultra-hip restaurant in a brownstone with a fabulous cocktail bar (very hot for date night!), and an ambiance that would rival the best hipster joints in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  The food was superb and our standout dishes were the Langkawi Shrimp Skewers (Malaysia), spinach Pupusas (El Salvador), the cheesy and eggy Khachapuri (Georgia), and the Lamb Kefta (Lebanon).  We also had the Spanish Street Potatoes and the Arancini which had the most amazing aromas.  Compass Rose does not take reservations but get here early! We arrived at 7:15 pm and were seated closer to 8:15 pm – drinks with catchy names like Girl, That’s Just How it Goes, kept us entertained! </p>


             <h3 class="fmob-sub">9) <a href="http://lediplomatedc.com/">Le Diplomate:</a></h3>




            <p align="justify">After a long day of exploring DC we needed a little dessert and Nupur took us to one of the best French inspired bistros.  Le Diplomathas a new pastry chef and had a selection of around a dozen desserts as well as seasonal sorbets.  We ordered the Warm <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/06/cherry-clafoutis-french-dessert-recipe.html">Cherry Clarfoutis</a>, Baba Au Rhum and a scoop of the homemade mint chocolate chip sorbet.  These were some of the freshest and best desserts I’ve had in a long time and the Warm Cherry Clafoutis was the standout – hands down! The almond cake was perfectly baked with crispy edges and chunks of tart ripe cherries.  The clafoutis was served with pistachio gelato which was amazing - light and refreshing with a big pop of pistachio flavor balanced perfectly with the cherries.  Two big thumbs up for Le Diplomate!</p>

             <h3 class="fmob-sub">10) <a href="http://starnoldsmusselbar.com/">St. Arnolds Mussel Bar</a>:</h3>

            <p align="justify">We ended the night and our trip to DC at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/st-arnolds-mussel-bar-washington">St. Arnolds Mussel Bar</a> where the loquacious bartender, Bruce, entertained us with stories from his past as we sipped crisp Belgian beers like the <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/718/2480/">Bavik pilsner</a> and the <a href="http://www.ommegang.com/#!beer_witte">Ommegang Witte</a> white ale.  We wished we had room in our bellies for one of the steaming hot garlicky pots of mussels (over 19 varieties on the menu!) but alas we were not wearing our stretchy pants.  This was a great local bar and the perfect ending to a great trip! </p>
