                Is your new year packed with resolutions? Have you signed up for that Zumba / kickboxing / under water basket weaving (with your hands tied behind your back… of course) classes? Resolutions are great; they get many of us from the point of nowhere to the proverbial point B. When most of us woke up on January 1st or January 2nd (Monday) this year, we scrambled to our laptops with resolution filled energy, coffee in one hand (hot, hot, hot!), texting our buddies in the other. We refreshed that Groupon page to search for that one class that will be ideally located within two miles from work; will start after 7:00 PM; in an area that will have excellent Wi-Fi coverage (free, of course); and within close proximity to a vegan juice bar (that has a loyalty program). #SELFIMPOSEDCONSTRAINTS!

                Perhaps it is time to let go off our cell phone and fancy Fitbit and prepare to get uncomfortable and step wayyyy out of our self-imposed comfort zone. This is exactly what my husband and I did. That too on January 1st 2017! We woke up extra early and headed to the Blue Cliff Monastery located in upstate NY (Pine Bush) for a day of Mindfulness - a “silent walking meditation” followed by “dharma talk” and a vegan lunch spread. This is something that the monastery offers to the public every <a href="https://www.bluecliffmonastery.org/come-for-the-day">Sunday</a>. And if I may add, free of charge!

            <p align="justify">
                At any point before we left home, had you asked us what “silent walking meditation” or “dharma talk” was… we would not be able to answer you. We don’t follow Buddhism and never knew anything about Vietnamese Buddhism that is followed in this monastery. We went with an open mind and a strong feeling that we wanted this year to not only be different than 2016 but also a year where we would feel rejuvenated.

                <a href="https://www.bluecliffmonastery.org/monastery/">Blue Cliff Monastery</a> is located in the Catskills region of NY State. It is every bit as beautiful as their website says it is. As soon as we got off the highway, we drove for couple of miles on a winding country road that was lined sparingly with farm houses and horse stables (reminded me of old quaint English villages). When you arrive at the monastery, you are greeted by a large stone out in the front that says- “I have arrived; I am home”. From this very second you know that you are in a different world and you will experience something that will prompt you to ask questions about the monotone that we call life. Blue Cliff is NOT a cult or a temple. They do not wish to convert you with the many merits of Buddhism. It is merely a sanctuary for anyone who wants to get in touch with their inner spiritual being. You don’t have to be particularly religious or have any religious affiliation - we don’t.

                We slowly made our way to the large log cabin style meditation center. It was warm and welcoming. We were asked to take a seat on the floor (which was lined with cushions) or on a pale yellow folding chairs. We still were not sure what exactly to expect, but that didn’t seem to matter. It is not a place that promotes anxiety, quite the opposite! Soon many people of different age groups and ethnicity piled in (there would have been around 60-80 in the audience) and three monks and a nun (female Buddhist monk) walked in clothed completely in brown. They started the days program wishing everyone and opened the floor for questions. Apparently there were many people there who visit this monastery often. The questions ranged from, “Why do monks and nuns shave their heads?” to “How does one handle the fear of death of a loved one?” This was not a contest; there are no prizes for the best question. The monks answered every question with the same amount of calmness and joy. FYI they shave their heads so they can continue to live a life of simplicity and not spend money on frivolous items like shampoo and blow dry! The monks reminded us that they wish to spread Mindfulness.

                Mindfulness happened to be a word that was repeated a lot. We met a novice nun after the Q&A session and she tried to explain what mindfulness is. She first proceeded to teach us “silent walking meditation”- With each breath you take a step. Inhale right. Hold. Exhale left. Repeat. You don’t match your breathe to your footstep but your feet follows your breathe.  A fantastic way to concentrate on the NOW and not on the “next step”! She then talked about mindfulness.  It is a thoughtful way of life-almost a philosophy that asks one to be present at the moment and always be aware of their speech and actions. Simply put, when we eat, we should be aware of where we are and what we put in our mouth (i.e. not munching on a burger in front of the idiot box). When we speak, we are conscience of our words and their implications. Sounded to me like a continuous state of meditation! Much later on the drive home, this got me thinking, when we are aware of our needs and the consequences of our actions (in order to achieve that need) - perhaps we will realize what implication our action may have on our immediate environment. Similar to how when we take something for granted, we do not know the price of our action. Maybe a great way to live sustainably?

            <p align="justify">
                We then proceeded to the “dharma talk”. This was modified to suit the occasion. We all sat in a circle and got a chance to talk about our resolution or what we wanted to continue to do in 2017. Would it surprise anyone that no one in the circle wanted to lose 10 lbs, get a promotion, visit Hawaii, or move to a bigger house? There was one common theme, spread joy, help friends and family and be mindful of their action. It looked like Buddha did hear us say that; a gong was sounded outside. Everyone took a moment of silence; to realize a session has ended and the next session lunch commenced. The nuns and volunteers of the monastery had prepared a vegan spread. No, not just tofu and kale, but salads, soup, brown rice, millet. You would not leave the place hungry! What is more joyful than enjoying your food with new found friends? Everyone there had a story to tell about their visit. Some were of the Christian faith who had traveled many miles to increase their spirituality. Others were Buddhist veterans who loved to share their experience with the faith.

                It had snowed enough the previous day to cover everything on the ground. As we were leaving, we noticed statues of Buddha by the frozen pond covered in snow. What is inner peace and mindfulness if not accepting our current environment, expressing silent gratitude for all our gifts and remaining calm? Happy mindful year ahead everyone!
