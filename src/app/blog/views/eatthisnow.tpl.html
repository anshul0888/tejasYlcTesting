            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it: Japan, Korea and Smorgasburg, New York!</b></p>


            <p align="justify"><a href="http://misshappyfeet.blogspot.com/2015/12/korea-originated-in-japan-crystal-water.html">Japanese water cake</a> or “Mizu Shingen Mochi”  has actually been around for years (and went viral in 2014 across Asia) but has recently started trending online in the US and is making its debut in New York this summer. This Japanese rice cake looks like a perfect drop of water but you can eat it with a spoon! Mochi Recipe - the water used to make the original version comes from the Japanese alps and is mixed with agar, a gelatin-like substance made from seaweed which gives it a melt-in-your-mouth feel (like jello but softer!).  However, unlike jello,these mochi rice cakes  water cake must be eaten within 30 minutes or it will turn into a sweet puddle of water.  It’s usually served with dark sugar syrup and kinako, a roasted soybean flour commonly served with other types of mochi. The water cake made it’s US debut at the <a href="http://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a> outdoor market in New York last month and we can’t wait to try it! It you don’t want to wait in the insane line you can also learn to make it at home by watching this video:</p>

            <h3 class="fmob-sub">Cricket Flour Protein Bars</h3>
            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get them: made by Exo and Chapul and sold online in the US/Canada and select stores</b></p>

            <p align="justify">According to <a href="https://www.exoprotein.com/">Exo’s website</a>, “Crickets are the new kale” and rightfully so.  On our quest to find protein alternatives that are sustainable and environmentally friendly cricket bars are the hot new thing.  It turns out that crickets produce 100X less greenhouse gases than cows and are a complete source of protein where cricket flour has 65% protein compared with chicken at 23% and eggs at 12%.  Crickets only need 17% of the food and less than 1% of the water and land resources than traditional livestock for the same amount of protein. There are several popular brands on the market that offer both sweet and savory bar options.  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/04/review-exo-a-cricket-based-protein-bar-that-wont-destroy-your-productivty/">Exo</a>, based out of Brooklyn brings exo protein bars in such flavors as banana bread, apple cinnamon, mango curry and barbecue.  Another brand, <a href="http://www.chapul.com/">Chapul</a>, featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aktlxYVu7xw">Shark Tank</a> has some adventurous flavors including coconut/ginger/lime and matcha tea/goji/nori.  It was recently announced that Publix supermarket started carrying Chapul protein bars – taking crickets mainstream! Did I mention you get about five crickets in each bite?! <a href="http://www.edibleinsects.com/">EntoMarket</a> sells edible edible bugs and insects for those slightly more adventurous including silkworm “dolls”, whole honey mustard crickets and even chocolate covered “superworms”.</p>

            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it: Kawaii Monster Café, Harajuku (Japan)</b></p>

            <p align="justify">Not only is the palate of paintable pasta a visual delight (and hidden food find) but the café it comes from is worth a visit since it looks like a unicorn’s playground. <a href="http://kawaiimonster.jp/pc/en/concept/">Kawaii Monster Café</a> is located in the heart of Harajuku, Tokyo and has the most colorful themed rooms where you can eat the palate of sausage pasta, including a “mushroom disco”, “milk stand” – compelte with giant animal heads that light up and even a giant “sweets go round” cake shaped merry-go-round (our inner 10 year old would be doing a happy dance at this dessert playground!). We were lucky that ultimate foodie, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beautilitarian/">Alex Michael May</a>, shared this with us!</p>

            <h3 class="fmob-sub">The Keyboard Waffle</h3>
            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it: Korea, <a href="http://www.nexoncomputermuseum.org/randing.php">Nexon Computer Museum</a> or you can buy your own keyboard waffle iron maker <a href="http://www.thekeyboardwaffleiron.com/new-products/the-keyboard-waffle-iron/">here</a></b></p>

            <p align="justify">While you are visiting the Nexon Computer Museum in South Korea you can feel like you never left the office while eating their signature breakfast – a keyboard shaped waffle! This amazingly accurate keyboard comes with several mouthwatering toppings including fresh berries and ice cream.  Bonus – it comes with a mouse shaped bun! What is even more impressive is that designer, Chris Dimino, sells the iron to make these marvelous creations on his website <a href="http://www.thekeyboardwaffleiron.com/#about-marquee">The Keyboard Waffle Iron</a>! Back in 2001, Dimino attended the School of Visual Arts, and created a conceptual design for the “typewriter waffle iron” as part of a school project.  In 2004 his idea and images went viral and a decade later (and after a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1304060422/the-keyboard-waffle-iron">Kickstarter campaign</a>) out came the keyboard waffle iron! The company that sells it is called Messy Desk Design and Dimino is currently working on secret project #2.  You can view Dimino’s Kickstarter campaign here:</p>

            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where do get it: Parts of Asia and Australia</b></p>

            <p align="justify">Tart frozen yogurt is still popular both in the US and Asia and last year Asian style ice cream rolls became trendy with lines for <a href="http://www.10belowicecream.com/">10Below Ice Cream</a> out the door in <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/NewYork-NY-USA">New York</a>.  However we are starting to see more and more spectacular images of cotton candy on top of ice cream via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aquas_au/?hl=en">instagram</a>.  Where are they coming from? One popular concoction is the Thunder Boom from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/REMICONE.SHOP/info?tab=overview">Remicone</a> in the heart of South Korea.  Their modern white structure looks like a fancy food truck you can step inside and only offers three ice cream flavors including milk, salted caramel and real chocolate.  However the real winners are the toppings – the most popular being “cotton thunder” which looks like a thunderstorm hit your dessert – fluffy grey clouds of cotton candy complete with candy lightning bolts! They also top their ice creams with macarons, which always makes us happy and they offer other colors and flavors of cotton candy.  Another popular option is the fairy-floss ice cream coming out of <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/SydneyNSW-Australia">Sydney</a>, Australia.  Jennifer Lam quit her accounting job to create <a href="http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/biting-into-australias-fairy-floss-ice-cream/60780">ridiculously unique desserts</a> at <a href="http://www.aquas.co/">Aqua S</a>, her most popular being baby blue swirls of sea salt soft-serve with a halo-like ring of fairy floss, sprinkled with popcorn and topped with a glazed marshmallow.  We can’t wait to try this on our next trip!</p>

            <p align="justify">So our instagrams blew up with images of the now viral rainbow cheese from <a href="http://kalatoast.com/">KALA Toast</a>, inconveniently located (for some) in Hong Kong.  What was even more amazing is that each color corresponds to a different flavor – green is basil, red is tomato and the blue supposedly tastes like lavender.  We were totally having a “foodie meltdown” (no put intended) but can now look forward to eating the “<a href="http://elitedaily.com/envision/rainbow-unicorn-grilled-cheese-us/1481722/">Unicorn Melt</a>” in Santa Monica, California.  It’s like a unicorn was butchered and put into a sandwich at Chomp Eatery & Juice Station.

            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get them: Around NYC</b></p>

            <p align="justify">We first ate phumplings while walking back from <a href="http://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a> in <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Brooklyn-NY-USA">Brooklyn</a> by accident last year.  As a lover of soup dumplings I just had to try them – even though they were expensive at $3 each! <a href="http://gothamist.com/2015/04/10/phumpling_phever.php">Phumplings</a> combine the popular Vietnamese pho (seasoned noodle soup) with chinese soup dumplings – just like xiaolongbao!  <a href="http://www.phumplings.com/">Phumpling Co</a>. now sells them out of a cart around Brooklyn and Manhattan with a schedule on their website.  They now come in both chicken and pork!</p>

            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it: worldwide</b></p>

            <p align="justify">There are two trends right now when it comes to lattes.  The first is the <a href="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/04/a-creative-barista-devises-method-for-pouring-rainbow-foam-lattes/">rainbow latte</a> where skilled baristas create colorful patterns with food coloring they swirl around a cup.  However the more interesting art form is 3D latte foam art.  The one pictured above is one of the best examples and comes a café called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Allegretto-Viva-Espresso-Hong-Kong-125324514301488/photos">Allegretto</a> in Hong Kong which is famous for creating cats “bathing” in its lattes. Who doesn’t want a cat in a latte?!?! We need to skip our morning Starbucks and request an upgrade – ASAP.

            <h3 class="fmob-sub space30">Ganoderma Luciderm Mushroom Coffee</h3>
            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it: worldwide</b></p>

            <p align="justify">This is a fairly new product in the US and the most popular company producing mushroom coffee is <a class="http://us.foursigmatic.com/products/mushroom-coffee">Four Sigmatic</a>, started by several friends out of Finland.  Four Sigmatic sells its medicinal mushroom powders in over 25 countries and is now based out of the US. This ganoderma coffee has all the benefits of coffee without the jitters and comes in individual packets you can add to hot water or even smoothies.  It is vegan, paleo-friendly and sugar free.  It turns out that medicinal mushrooms are not cooking mushrooms and unlike Portobello, button and shitake mushrooms these medicinal ones grow on or near trees. Medicinal mushrooms can not be eaten by cooking them, instead their nutrients are extracted by water or alcohol extraction. The main varieties of medicinal mushrooms used to make coffee are are Reishi, Maitake, Lingzhi, Chaga and Cordyceps.  So my next question – does it actually <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffwilliams/2016/03/31/mushroom-mania-mushrooms-are-turning-up-in-coffee-bacon-and-almost-everything-else-imaginable/#2545c3a36b5e">taste like mushrooms</a>? According to reviews on Amazon of Four Sigmatic, mushroom coffee actually contains some coffee and tastes like coffee – not like mushrooms!  However it is a great anti-oxidant and superfood - so worth a shot.</p>

            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get it:</b></p>

            <p align="justify">Yes, you can now buy a $150 tequila patron platinum doughnut in Brooklyn’s <a href="http://www.manilasocialclub.com/donuts/">Manila Social Club</a>.  Bjorn DelaCruz is the mad scientist behind this dessert created from real silver and platinum foil that is weightless.  However this doughnut looks like something out of a science fiction movie and looks more like art than like dessert. These are rose petal doughnuts filled with cream and a spicy ginger-jalapeno patron margarita jelly and then covered in tequila frosting then topped with the metallic sheets. The dough is made of powderized rose ashes, giving it a purple color.  Sales of the extravagant treat are being donated to the American Cancer Society so you shouldn’t feel that bad about eating this mind-buster.</p>

            <h3 class="fmob-sub">Meat Bars</h3>
            <p align="justify" class="space10"><b>Where to get them: retail and online worldwide</b></p>

            <p align="justify">Another popular food trend is the meat bar. People are looking for easier and more efficient ways to get the protein they need and meat bars can certainly be a good option.  Unlike beef jerky, which is full of nitrates and preservatives, these mostly organic meat bars are usually paleo-friendly and made with grass fed meats, vegetables and seeds.  One popular brand is Brooklyn based <a href="http://www.bricksbars.com/the-bars-1/">Bricks Bars</a> which makes meat bars in three flavors: Turkey with sweet potato, cranberry and pumpkin; grass fed beef, uncured bacon, cranberry and sunflower seed; grass fed beef, carrot, apple and hemp seed. <a href="https://www.epicbar.com/">EPIC Bar</a> is another popular brand based out of <a href="https://www.yourlocalcousin.com/locations/Austin-TX-USA">Austin</a>, Texas, which also uses chicken and bison in its bars.  Get your hands on one of these bars for your next snack or camping trip!</p>
