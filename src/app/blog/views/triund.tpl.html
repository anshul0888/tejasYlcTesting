            <p align="justify">There's a little slice of heaven far up in Himachal Pradesh that goes by the name Triund. Practically everybody who visits or stays in Dharamsala, especially McLeod Ganj and Dharamkot, has heard fantastic stories about it, possibly visited it and have stories of their own or plan a vacation there in the near future. But to actually do the four-hour trek up to the mountain top and snow line after passing through valleys, forests and pine woods is more than rewarding. Sure, it takes a whole lot of scenic pee breaks and the compulsory stop at Magic View, a cafe that was started in 1984 in the middle of nowhere and claims to be the oldest in India to reach. But nothing prepares you for just how unreal the experience and setting gets when you finally arrive there.

            <p align="justify">Despite having reached sometime in the afternoon, the mist made it feel like some odd time of the day that was not yet defined. Squinting my eyes to see clearly, I could only make out a few things in the distance - what looked like a Hindu shrine with yellow prayer flags, two little shacks, no human silhouettes and four-legged creatures lazing about, though I couldn't decipher whether they were horses or donkeys. I was travelling with four other Israelis, whom I had met down at my guesthouse in Dharamkot and who made the sweetest attempt at speaking in English rather than Hebrew for their little Indian friend. Exploring would have to wait because on reaching, we immediately asked for food at the closest shack and within minutes, the man had prepared us each a thaali of piping hot rice, dal and potatoes - basic Indian food that satisfies the soul!

            <div class="space20">

            </div>

            <p align="justify">The next few hours passed by beautifully, with the lot of us jamming and taking turns to play the guitar and harmonica (I merely sang my heart out), escaping from deadly spiders that shared the shack with us, and helping the shack owner set up our tents for a surprisingly cheap price - 300 Rs per night per person. One of the most interesting part of the trip was speaking to the locals there who ran the shacks (I was the translator) and discovering the tedious weekly process of mules bringing up supplies like toilet paper, rice and mineral water to last a week. It was fascinating to hear stories of the people they had encountered - from school children who came there on a group picnic to meditating monks to merry-making foreigners to drunk Indians whom they were always wary of. Dinner was pretty much the same as lunch, with the addition of Maggi and whiskey that we had carried with us to keep us warm. Well-fed, warm and tipsy, we went to bed at merely 10 pm even though it felt like 2 am. It had been months since the last time I had slept in a sleeping bag and despite the weird sounds I heard outside the tent or the creepy crawlies inside, I had the most rejuvenating, dreamless sleep.

            <p align="justify">The one thing I have learnt during my solo travels is to travel like a local, not a tourist. This means trying to follow their lifestyle as much as possible and watching them go about their daily chores, if not participate in it. And that is precisely why I set my alarm at 5 am after finding out the previous night when the shack owners wake up. Not sleepy or grumpy as I usually would have been at that time, I sat and chatted with him over a cup of tea, found myself a nice spot behind grazing cows to answer Nature's call and took off with my camera. The mist had cleared, the nearby mountains now in full view, and the peeking sun's rays falling on the majestic silhouettes creating the most beautiful painting in my mind. I had befriended a mountain dog with the fluffiest tail and along with him (or her), I climbed higher and higher up until the campsite was a mere speck in the distance, my now awaking friends little moving stick figures against a most magnificent setting. My goal was to follow the sun as it hit each peak and as I did so, scampering and climbing my way up steep rocks, I encountered an angry bull that I just about escaped from, found Tibetan prayer flags in an isolated landing and felt truly happy, almost as if I was reborn on that mountain top. I am not a spiritual person, do not meditate and have never done enough yoga to do a full split. But at that moment, I knew that something special was taking place, and today, when I think about it, I would give anything to go back there and experience whatever it was that I did.

            <div class="space20">

            </div>

            <p align="justify">A few hours later, I returned to the campsite scavenging for food and my friends, who thought I had been eaten by the leopard that was rumoured to haunt these parts, were relieved to see me. It was a perfectly sunny morning and over bread, eggs and coffee, we did group yoga, played with ponies and just relaxed like it was nobody's business. Another group of Israelis who had just reached Triund and were in awe of the place also joined us, asking us the usual touristy questions like where to take a dump and what to eat. We discovered that on their way up, some locals had informed them that a bear had been spotted nearby and this gave us a whole new thrill to make the long journey back. We bid this beautiful terrain adieu, vowed to return and take this unique vacation together in ten years' time, took a group photo where we had the biggest grins possible and started our descent back to civilization. Unfortunately, we did not encounter a bear. But we did caught in a terrible storm, fell sick by the time we got back to our room and met again for an exceptional dinner at Buddha Delight, our favorite restaurant in Dharamkot, and raised a much-deserved toast to the life-changing journey we had just completed.
